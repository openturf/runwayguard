# Advanced Runway Risk Intelligence (ARRI) System

## Overview

The Advanced Runway Risk Intelligence (ARRI) system represents a significant enhancement to the basic Runway Risk Index (RRI) calculation. It incorporates sophisticated atmospheric modeling, performance analysis, and machine learning principles to provide comprehensive risk assessment for runway operations.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Atmospheric Modeling (`AdvancedAtmosphericModel`)

#### Thermal Gradient Risk Analysis
- **Purpose**: Assess thermal activity effects on aircraft performance and turbulence
- **Factors Analyzed**:
  - Temperature and dewpoint spread combinations
  - Time-of-day thermal activity patterns
  - Temperature inversion conditions
- **Risk Points**: Up to 20 points

#### Atmospheric Stability Index
- **Purpose**: Evaluate convective potential and mechanical turbulence
- **Factors Analyzed**:
  - Convective instability indicators
  - Mechanical turbulence from wind shear
  - Multi-layer atmospheric conditions
- **Risk Points**: Up to 30 points

### 2. Performance Risk Analysis (`PerformanceRiskAnalyzer`)

#### Runway Performance Risk Assessment
- **Purpose**: Calculate runway adequacy based on conditions and aircraft performance
- **Factors Analyzed**:
  - Runway length vs. aircraft requirements
  - Contamination effects (dry, wet, snow, ice, slush)
  - Density altitude performance degradation
  - Weight and balance considerations
- **Risk Points**: Up to 35 points

#### Weight Performance Factor Calculation
- **Purpose**: Quantify performance degradation due to atmospheric conditions
- **Formula**: Considers ISA temperature deviation and density altitude effects
- **Output**: Performance degradation factor for takeoff/landing calculations

### 3. Advanced Weather Risk Analysis (`WeatherRiskAnalyzer`)

#### Precipitation Intensity Risk
- **Purpose**: Detailed analysis of precipitation types and intensities
- **Categories**:
  - Heavy precipitation (20-50 points)
  - Moderate precipitation (8-25 points)
  - Light precipitation (3-15 points)
- **Special Considerations**: Freezing precipitation gets higher weighting

#### Turbulence Risk Assessment
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive turbulence prediction
- **Factors Analyzed**:
  - Gust factor analysis (ratio of gust to steady wind)
  - High wind mechanical turbulence
  - Terrain enhancement effects
- **Risk Points**: Up to 25 points

### 4. Risk Correlation Engine (`RiskCorrelationEngine`)

#### Multi-Domain Risk Amplification
- **Purpose**: Identify dangerous combinations of risk factors
- **Analysis Areas**:
  - Wind risks (tailwind, crosswind, gusts)
  - Weather risks (thunderstorms, visibility, icing)
  - Performance risks (density altitude, temperature)
- **Amplification Examples**:
  - Icing + Low ceiling = Instrument approach risk
  - Thunderstorm + High winds = Extreme turbulence
  - High DA + Challenging winds = Reduced safety margins

### 5. Predictive Risk Modeling (`PredictiveRiskModel`)

#### Trend Analysis
- **Purpose**: Assess risk based on evolving conditions
- **Factors Analyzed**:
  - Pressure tendency (rapid drops indicate approaching weather)
  - Temperature trends with time of day
  - Historical weather pattern correlation
- **Risk Points**: Up to 20 points

## Configuration System

### Aircraft Categories
- **Light**: Single-engine aircraft < 12,500 lbs
- **Light Twin**: Twin-engine aircraft < 12,500 lbs
- **Turboprop**: Turboprop-powered aircraft
- **Light Jet**: Jets < 41,000 lbs
- **Heavy**: Aircraft > 41,000 lbs

### Risk Profiles
- **Conservative**: Lower risk tolerance (0.8x thresholds)
- **Standard**: Balanced assessment (1.0x thresholds)
- **Aggressive**: Higher risk tolerance (1.2x thresholds)

### Configurable Thresholds
All risk thresholds can be adjusted based on:
- Aircraft type and performance characteristics
- Pilot experience level
- Operational requirements
- Environmental conditions

## API Implementation

### Enhanced Brief Endpoint

The `/brief` endpoint now returns additional data:

```json
{
  "runway_briefs": [
    {
      "runway": "09",
      "length": 5000,
      "terrain_factor": 1.1,
      "density_altitude_diff_ft": 1250,
      "runway_risk_index": 35,
      "advanced_analysis": {
        "thermal_conditions": ["Strong thermal activity expected"],
        "atmospheric_stability": ["High convective potential"],
        "runway_performance": ["Runway performance adequate"],
        "precipitation_analysis": ["Light rain may affect runway"],
        "turbulence_analysis": ["Moderate gustiness expected"],
        "risk_amplification": ["Multiple risk domains active"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

- Original `calculate_rri()` function remains unchanged
- New `calculate_advanced_rri()` provides enhanced capabilities
- Existing API responses include all original fields
- Additional fields provide enhanced analysis without breaking existing integrations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Advanced Analysis
```python
from functions.core_calculations import calculate_advanced_rri

rri, contributors = calculate_advanced_rri(
    head=5, cross=10, gust_head=8, gust_cross=15,
    wind_speed=12, wind_gust=18, is_head=True, gust_is_head=True,
    da_diff=1500, metar_data=metar, lat=40.7128, lon=-74.0060,
    rwy_heading=90, runway_length=4000, terrain_factor=1.1
)
```

### Configuration-Based Analysis
```python
from functions.advanced_config import ConfigurationManager

config = ConfigurationManager.get_config_for_aircraft("c172", "private")
# Use config to customize risk thresholds and analysis parameters
```
