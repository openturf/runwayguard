# RunwayGuard Advanced Algorithm Documentation

## Overview
RunwayGuard is a next-generation aviation safety system that provides real-time runway risk assessment through a sophisticated multi-factor analysis. The system combines meteorological data, aerodynamic calculations, temporal factors, atmospheric modeling, performance analysis, and probabilistic modeling to generate a comprehensive Runway Risk Index (RRI).

## Core Architecture

### 1. Dual Calculation Engines
- **Basic RRI Engine**: `calculate_rri()` - Original algorithm for backward compatibility
- **Advanced RRI Engine**: `calculate_advanced_rri()` - Comprehensive analysis with atmospheric modeling

### 2. Advanced Atmospheric Modeling (`AdvancedAtmosphericModel`)

#### Thermal Gradient Analysis
```python
# Thermal activity risk assessment
if temp_c > 25 and dewpoint_spread > 10 and time_of_day in ["afternoon", "midday"]:
    score += 15  # Strong thermal activity expected
```

#### Atmospheric Stability Index
- Convective potential analysis
- Temperature inversion detection
- Mechanical turbulence prediction
- Dewpoint spread correlation with instability

### 3. Performance Risk Analysis (`PerformanceRiskAnalyzer`)

#### Runway Performance Modeling
- Aircraft category-specific analysis

- Density altitude performance degradation
- Effective runway length calculations

#### Contamination Multipliers
```python
contamination_multipliers = {
    "dry": 1.0,
    "wet": 1.15,
    "standing_water": 1.4,
