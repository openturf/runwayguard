# RunwayGuard Algorithm Documentation

## Overview
RunwayGuard is a next-generation aviation safety system that provides real-time runway risk assessment through a sophisticated multi-factor analysis. The system combines meteorological data, aerodynamic calculations, temporal factors, and probabilistic modeling to generate a comprehensive Runway Risk Index (RRI).

## Core Components

### 1. Wind Component Analysis
- Headwind/tailwind decomposition
- Crosswind calculation
- Gust factor analysis
```python
headwind = wind_speed * cos(θ)
crosswind = wind_speed * sin(θ)
θ = (wind_direction - runway_heading) % 360
```

### 2. Environmental Calculations

#### Density Altitude Computation
```python
pressure_altitude = field_elevation + (29.92 - altimeter) * 1000
isa_temp = 15 - (2 * field_elevation / 1000)
density_altitude = pressure_altitude + (120 * (actual_temp - isa_temp))
```

### 3. Probabilistic Risk Assessment

The system employs Monte Carlo simulation to provide confidence intervals:
- Generates 500 perturbations of wind conditions
- Accounts for natural variability in:
  * Wind direction (±5 degrees)
  * Wind speed (±2 knots)
  * Gust differential preservation
- Produces RRI_p05 and RRI_p95 confidence bounds

### 4. Time-Based Risk Factors

Sophisticated solar position calculations for:
- Day/Night/Twilight determination
- Sun glare risk assessment
- Runway-specific solar interference
```python
risk_points = base_points + time_risk + glare_risk
max_time_risk_points = 30
```

### 5. Runway Risk Index (RRI) Calculation

#### Base Components (0-30 points each)
- Tailwind: 6 points/kt (max 30)
- Crosswind: 2 points/kt (max 30)

#### Gust Factor (0-40 points)
- Differential: 2 points/kt (max 20)
- Gust tailwind: 1 point/kt (max 10)
- Gust crosswind: 0.5 points/kt (max 10)

#### Environmental Factors
- Density altitude: 0.015 points/ft above field elevation (max 30)
- Time of day: Up to 30 points

#### Weather Phenomena
Automatic Risk Adjustments:
- Thunderstorms (TS): 100 points (EXTREME)
- Lightning (LTG): +25 points
- Funnel Cloud (FC): 100 points (EXTREME)
- Hail (GR): +40 points
- Freezing Precipitation (FZ): +30 points
- Heavy Precipitation (+): +20 points

#### Ceiling Thresholds
- < 500ft: +40 points
- < 1000ft: +30 points
- < 2000ft: +20 points
- < 3000ft: +10 points

#### Visibility Thresholds
- < 1 SM: +40 points
- < 2 SM: +30 points
- < 3 SM: +20 points
- < 5 SM: +10 points
