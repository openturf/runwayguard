# Commercial Use Policy for RunwayGuard

Thank you for your interest in RunwayGuard. This tool is licensed under a modified MIT License that allows open non-commercial use, but **commercial usage requires permission** from the author.

These use cases **do not require permission**:
- Personal preflight risk analysis
- Flight school demos and classroom use

## ❌ What Counts as Commercial Use

## 💬 Requesting Permission

Please email **andrew@openturf.org** with:
- A short description of the commercial project
- The company or team name
- Project website (if available)
- Whether you intend to use the API, codebase, or both
- Expected monthly usage or volume (if known)

We usually respond in 2–3 business days. Depending on the use case, we may:
- Grant a **free license** for small-scale or low-revenue projects
- Offer a **flat-rate commercial license**
- Explore **revenue share or donation-based support**

## 🧾 Hosted API Use

Use of the hosted API (e.g. `rwyguard.openturf.org/api/...`) is subject to fair-use limits.  
If you need higher volume, custom endpoints, or SLA guarantees, contact us for access options.

> **Note:** RunwayGuard depends on live FAA public data feeds, which sometimes come with limits or stability risks outside our control. Hosted access is best-effort but not guaranteed for sustained commercial traffic unless specifically arranged.

## 💡 Why This Policy Exists

We truly don’t want to force anyone to pay — we built RunwayGuard to help pilots stay safe and make smarter decisions. It runs off open FAA data and our own time and resources, and we’re doing our best to keep it fast, accurate, and free to use.

That said, if you're building a product or service that earns money, we’d really appreciate it if you support the project — even just with a donation or small license. We're not trying to get rich — just to keep this tool alive and well-maintained for everyone.
