- **Enhanced Airport Info Parser** (`functions/getairportinfo.py`)
  * Added runway length extraction from FAA API "Dimension:" field
  * Parser now correctly handles format: `Runway: 18/36 Dimension: 7002x150 Surface: C Align: 182`
  * Extracts both runway heading (182°) and length (7002 feet) from single API response
  * Maintains backward compatibility for airports without dimension data

### Impact
- **Runway Performance Analysis** now uses real runway lengths instead of estimates
- **Risk Assessment Accuracy** significantly improved for airports with published runway data
- **Specific Performance Warnings** now possible (e.g., "concerning: 2053ft effective length")
- **Multi-runway Airports** properly analyzed with individual runway specifications

### Validation Results
- **KACT Airport**: Successfully parsing both runways
  * 01/19: 7107 feet → "adequate but tight: 2859ft effective length"
  * 14/32: 5103 feet → "concerning: 2053ft effective length"
- **KTKI Airport**: 18/36: 7002 feet → proper performance analysis

### Technical Details
- Enhanced text parsing logic to extract runway dimensions alongside alignment data
- Improved data structure to include optional `length` field in runway objects
- Maintained graceful fallback for airports without published runway dimension data
